# JavaScript mini projects

Projects to practice web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

🌤️ [Weather app](weather%20app): An application that shows the current weather information of a city chosen by the user. The application displays data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

✅ [To-Do List App](to-do%20list%20app): This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and delete them. The project saves the task list in the browser, ensuring the data remains available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

🧠 [Quiz App](quiz%20app): This application allows users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions, each with four possible answers. Once an answer is selected, it’s immediately checked and marked as correct or incorrect — and cannot be changed. After answering all questions, the app displays the final score, giving users instant feedback on their performance.

🔐 [Password Generator](password%20generator): A tool that generates a strong and secure random password using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The app also includes a copy button, allowing users to easily copy the newly generated password.
